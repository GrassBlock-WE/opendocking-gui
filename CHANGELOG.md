# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The project is pre-1.0. The `0.x` line is where the interfaces still move.

## [0.1.0] — first public release

Initial release of the engine, the Python front end, and the 3-D workbench.

### Added

**Engine (`dock-core`, GPL-3.0-or-later, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`)**

- AutoDock Vina and Vinardo empirical scoring, as an analytic first-order
  gradient plus per-conformation forces.
- Precalculated affinity maps over a 4-slot grid. Donor and acceptor
  contributions are split into separate maps, which removes the
  donor–donor pseudo-hydrogen-bonds a single `e_hb` map produces.
- Ligand parameterisation as `6 + n_torsion` DOF: translation, SO(3) rotation
  via the exponential map, and one torsional angle per rotatable bond. The
  torsion set is required to be a cut set of the molecular graph.
- Global search: iterative local search (Metropolis acceptance, local-frame
  perturbation) with `exhaustiveness` independent trajectories on rayon, plus
  an optional island-model LGA.
- Local optimisation: L-BFGS with an Armijo sufficient-decrease test, which is
  required because the trilinear interpolant is only C⁰ across cell faces.
- Pose de-duplication by per-atom RMSD, with a steric-clash partition *before*
  clustering so a physically impossible pose cannot consume a cluster slot.
  `rejected_pose_count` is reported when no clean pose is found at all.
- Grid map export in AutoDock `.map` format, and a configurable point cap so an
  oversized box fails cleanly instead of exhausting memory.
- Optional `gpu` feature: a WGSL compute path over the same interpolation
  kernel as the CPU, with explicit backend reporting and fallback reasons.
- Robustness: malformed `.pdbqt` input produces a catchable error rather than a
  `panic = "abort"` that would kill the calling interpreter.

**Python bindings and front end (`dock-py`, distribution `opendocking`)**

- `Receptor`, `Ligand`, `GridBox`, `GridMaps`, `DockingResult` wrappers with a
  zero-copy contract: input NumPy arrays are borrowed by Rust, never copied;
  outputs are moved once.
- RDKit-backed structure preparation: aromaticity, protonation, Gasteiger
  charges, and polar-hydrogen placement for donors and acceptors.
- A single 79-column PDBQT writer and reader pair, used by both the CLI and the
  workbench, so anything written can be read back.
- `opendocking` command line: `prep-receptor`, `prep-ligand`, `rec-grid`,
  `dock`, `split`, `info`, `workbench`.
- `odgui`, a standalone entry point for the interactive workbench that does not
  depend on any particular command name and imports neither Qt nor moderngl at
  module scope, so `odgui --check` and `odgui --help` work on a machine with no
  graphics stack.
- Workbench: per-atom element colouring from an explicit PDBQT-type table,
  per-atom radii, pose browsing sorted by energy with RMSD-to-best, a search
  box tool, and docking on a worker thread so the window stays responsive.

**Documentation**

- `docs/SCORING.md` — every term derived from the formula down to the line of
  code, with each deliberate deviation from Vina marked.
- `docs/VERIFICATION.md` — what was actually run, what the results were, and
  an explicit list of what was not verified.
- `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Known limitations

Carried over from [`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md); the two that
matter most:

- **No redocking validation.** There is no evidence the engine places a known
  ligand back into its crystallographic pocket.
- **No cross-validation against AutoDock Vina.** Absolute kcal/mol values must
  not be compared with Vina output or literature numbers. Relative ordering,
  pose quality and geometric sanity can be used.

Verified on Windows 11 x86_64 with an NVIDIA RTX 3050 Laptop GPU. macOS, Linux,
AMD, Intel integrated graphics and Apple Silicon are untested.
